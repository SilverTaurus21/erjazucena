                    <h4>Software Development</h4>
                        <p>
                            I have been working as a software developer for four years and have two years of technical experience in hardware as well. I am enthusiastic about enhancing my skills and learning new programming practices alongside my colleagues. Drawing on my experience as a team player, I always prioritize the importance of effective communication and meticulous documentation in all developed systems

                    <h4>System Anaylist</h4> 
                        <p>
                            I gained experience in system analysis and preparing multiple detailed debugging reports for both software and hardware. This involved adapting complex designs, solutions, and technical details to resolve various potential issues and improve overall functionality for both backend and frontend. Additionally, I worked closely with production teams to achieve broad strategic objectives

                        <p>
                            I have experience in Technical Hardware Support with a retail company for over two years. During my tenure, I gained a basic understanding of fixing minor problems in printers, wire cabling, monitors, and cash-drawers, in addition to my software development experience. I regularly interacted with employees to comprehend the problems and requests as they came in

                        <p>
                            I have experience in ensuring the product quality of each project and service from a user-side perspective by effectively debugging errors. I have also gained an understanding of the importance of applying quality assurance practices to eliminate issues before they occur, thus improving the end product and user experience.

                            I have one year of experience in Android Java Development gained through my freelance projects, and four years of C# development experience from my previous job with a retail company. These positions have provided me with the opportunity to develop skills across both Android and C#. I have honed my abilities to write scalable, clean, and maintainable code.

                        <p>
                            I have experience in adhering to design systems, specifically in my last project called Noah's Ark, a desktop-type project. For the past four years, I focused mainly on desktop-type projects. However, my interest in web design and its unique design systems has continuously prompted me to expand my skillset to accommodate new possibilities while still diligently honing my craft and sharpening skills, with an interest in developing new ideas that cater to various age groups and satisfy a user's needs by designing more user-friendly user interfaces
